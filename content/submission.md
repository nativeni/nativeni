# Submission instructions

Authors should __submit only original__ work that has not been published before and is no under submission to any other venue.

All submitted papers will be assessed through a __double-blind review process__. This means that the authors do not see who are the reviewers and the reviewers do not see who are the authors. 

As an author, you should do your best to ensure that your paper submission does not directly or indirectly reveal the authors' identities.  These following steps are minimal requirements for a double-blind submission:
* Remove all personal information about the authors from the paper (e.g., names, affiliations).
* Remove acknowledgements to organizations and/or people.
* Referring to your previous work should be done similarly to any other work, as if your are not an author of that work.
* Do not add references to external repositories or technical reports that can be used to identify any of the authors or institutions/organization. 
* Uploading a version of the paper to a non-peer-reviewed location (e.g., ArXiv) is acceptable. However, authors need to avoid advertising the paper on popular mailing list and social media until after the review process closes.

As reviewers, PC members should not actively try to de-anonymize the authors' identities.  Any violation of the double-blind reviewing process should be reported to the PC chais.


Submissions should be __six pages maximum, plus one page for references, in 2-column 10pt ACM format__. When using Latex, please download the style and templates from 
[here](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip).

Uncompress the zip file and look for `sample-sigconf.tex` in the `sample/` subdirectory. The file can be used as a starting point, or the confiation can be copied to your own file if one exists. In any case, your text file should use the following class

```
\documentclass[10pt,sigconf,letterpaper,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
```

We encourage authors to __share code/data at either submission time or at the camera ready__.
