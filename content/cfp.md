# Call for papers

In recent years we witnessed a growing interest towards __leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to innovate network operations__ at all layers, domains and planes. Yet, __if, what and where we need to integrate intelligence in networks and how to (re)design networks for the native support of AI is still largely under debate__. This is due to the multi-faceted nature of the challenges behind
such integration: on the one hand, network architectures must be updated to accommodate AI models and their lifecycle by design (e.g., collecting and provisioning data in real-time, balancing centralized versus distributed computing approaches, empowering low latency requirements for fast closed-loop decision-making and network function automation); on the other hand, the design of AI models shall improve to better align with the myriad of requirements of production network systems (e.g., inference latency, computational complexity, trustworthiness of AI decisions); finally, operational procedures in research must be enhanced for verifiabilty, reproducibility and real-world deployment (e.g., establishing reference datasets, sharing trained models without sacrificing models explainability, robustness or safety).

Pragmatic answers to all these points are paramount to enable a transition of the current large body of literature on AI for networking from academic exercises to solutions integrated in production systems.

This workshop aims to bringing together researchers from academia and industry who are committed to making AI in networks a reality. We call for contributions from researchers working in the areas of network systems, applied machine learning and data science. __We seek contributions that range from visionary position papers to promising ideas and prototypes, all the way to fully deployed solutions__. All submissions should contribute to the common goal of making AI a viable and native technology for networks.

- Network architectures and infrastructures for native AI support
